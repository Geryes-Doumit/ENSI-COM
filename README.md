## Requirements

- Android 7 or higher

## Using the app

ENSI'COM is a very straightforward application :

Install the .apk file on your Android phone to test the application out.
On the main page, you'll see two tabs:
- The news tab that contains the users' validated posts. 
- The events tab that contains a calendar which can show you the future events that are already planned. 

- You can interact with the posts by linking them and commenting on them. You can also reply to other comments. 
- To see the events of a day, simply press on the day in the calendar.

- You'll notice a button at the top left corner, which, when pressed, will allow you to access your profile and settings.
